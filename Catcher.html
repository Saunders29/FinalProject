                <p>
                   Catchers are the captain of the field the because they stand behind home plate
                    they can see everything that goes on. They tell what pitch they want the pitcher to throw 
                   the tell their team where to throw the ball when runners are advancing to
                   bases because they can see it all happening in front of them. Catchers are tyipically bigger guys
                   that can throw well. Also tend to be stong because that have to be able to catch the ball from the Pitcher
                   and stay firm so the ball looks like it stays in the strike zone. 
                   Catching in my opinion is the most difficut position on the baseball field.
                   They wear gear to protect themselves from if the pitcher throws it in
                   the dirt and they use their body to keep it in front of them, or the batter fouls the ball and it 
                   tips back and hits them.
