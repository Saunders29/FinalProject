                <p>
                   Catchers Are the captain of the field the stand behind home plate
                   so they can see everything that goes on. The tell what pitch they want the pitcher to throw 
                   the tell their team where to throw the ball when runners are advancing 
                   bases because they can see it all happeing in fron of them. Catchers are tyipically bigger guys
                   that can throw well. Also tend to be stong because that have to be able to catch the ball from the Pitcher
                   and stay firm so the ball looks like it stays in the strike zone. 
                   Catching in my opinion is the most difficut postion on the baseball field.
                   Theye wear gear to protect themselves for one if the pitcher throws it in
                   the dirt and they use their body to keep it in front, or the batter foul 
                   tips it back into them.
