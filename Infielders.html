                <p>
                    Infielders are catorgized in 2 differenet groups corner Infielders and Middle Infielders.
                    The corner in fielders are 1st baseman and 3rd baseman. 
                    These guys are typically bigger and slower that can hit really well. 
                    The middle infielders are the shortstop and the 2nd baseman. 
                    These guys are smaller and quicker and typically they get the most action in a game.
                    Infielders need to be good at fielding balls that are hit on the ground and pick it up and throw it 
                    to the appropriate base to get the runners out.
