                <p>
                    Infielders are catorgized in 2 differenet groups corner Infielders and Middle Infielders.
                    The corner in fielders are 1st baseman and 3rd baseman. 
                    These guys are typically bigger and slower that can hit really well. 
                    The middle infielders are the shortstop and the 2nd baseman. 
                    These guys are smaller and quicker and typically they get the most action in a game. 
                    The infield unlike the outtfield as 4 players to cover a much smaller area this is becasue
                    the balls that get hit on the ground can come really fast and typically you only have time to take a couple
                    steps after the ball is hit. This makes it difficult on the hitter to get a hit on a ball that
                    is hit on the ground you are much more likely to hit the ball close to someone than hitting it into the outfield.
                    Infielders need to be good at fielding balls that are hit on the ground and pick it up and throw it 
                    to the appropriate base to get the runners out.
