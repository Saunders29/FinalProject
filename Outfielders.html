                <p>
                    Outfielders are typically the faster players on the team. 
                    They need to be fast because there are only 3 of them to cover the whole outfield,
                    which is a very large area and their main objective is to catch any ball hit into the air.
                    The 3 out field positions are left Field, Center Field, and Right Field. 
                    Their location is as if your back is to home plate so left field would be to your left.
                    If they catch it in the air its an out. Outfield also need to be able to throw the ball far
                    and accurate. This is becasue if the ball is on the groud or out of the outfileders reach
                    they have to get it and throw it to whatever base the runner is trying to get too.
                    The picture below on the left is to show how much area the 3 outfields have to cover on a
                    full sized field.
