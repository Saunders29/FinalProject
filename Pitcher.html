                    The pitcher is probably the most important player on the field. 
                    The reason is nothing can happpen untill he thorws the ball. He is fully in control of the game.
                    Pitchers tyipically have 3 main types of pitches.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Fastball
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>4 Seam</strong> that is stright</li>
                                <li><strong>2 Seam </strong> ball kind of tails towdard the side your arm is on</li>
                                <li><strong>Cutter</strong> the ball tails away from your glove side</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Change Up
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Circle Change-Up</strong> this pitch is suposesed to look like a Fastball but slower</li>
                                <li><strong>Tradition Change-Up</strong> this pitch does the same thing just which pitch is more comfortable</li>
                                <li><strong>Fork ball</strong> is a pitch thats really slow and drops a lot very hard to throw for a strike</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Breaking Ball
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Curve Ball</strong> This pitch does what the name says you actually make the ball curve from one side to the other</li>
                                <li><strong>Slider</strong> this pitch is simliar to the curve ball its typically thrown harder and doesnt move as much</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>    
                    </ol>
                        <br>
                    Most pitchers will have anywhere form 3 of these pitches to almost all of them.
                    The most important thing with these pitches is that you have to be able to throw whatever pitches 
                    you have for a strike. A strike is a zone that is the width of home plate and the height 
                    from the hitters knees to mid torso. If it not in that zone the its a ball if you throw 4 balls 
                    to one batter they get on base for free. Thats why most pitchers have about 3-5 differenet pitches they 
                    master to be able to throw consistently where they want them in the zone.
