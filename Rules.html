                <div class="paragraph">
                    Baseball is a very complex game to many it's boring becasue people dont fully understand whats going on.
                    There are 2 two teams of 9 players on each team. A game constist of innings typically 7 or 9 there is no time limit.
                    An inning is split into two halves top half the way team hits and the bottom half the home team hits. 
                    You switch half innings when the team playing defensegets 3 outs. 
                    The way a team scores is by a a batter running to every base 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>,and then home plate.
                    A full sized baseball field doesnt have to be an exact size like a football does but theyre are certain requirements that a field must meet.
                    The the bases must be 90 feet away frome each other in a stright line, and home plate to the rubber on the pitchers mound must 
                    be 60ft and 6in away. You want to put the fence far enough away so that it's difficult
                    to hit it over the fence but not imposible.
