                <div class="paragraph">
                    Basball is a very complex game to many it boring becasue they dont fully understand whats going on.
                    There are 2 two teams and the game constist of innings typically 7 or 9. An inning is split into two halfs
                    top half the way team hits and the bottom half the home team hits. You switch half innings when the team playing defense
                    gets 3 outs.
                    <br>
                    <strong>3 types of ways to get an out </strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Force Out
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Tag Out
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fly out
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    A force out is when the player on the defense with the ball touches the bag before the baserunner gets there.
                    You can only do this if the baserunner is running to a bag that he is forced to run too. 
                    First base is always a force out becasue once you hit it then you have to go to first. 
                    And example of not a force out would be if there was a guy only on second and the batter
                    hits the ball the guy on second doesnt half to run becasue no one is currently on first. 
                    This case if the baserunner decides to go to third you must try and tag him out. 
                    The Player with the ball must physically tag the baserunner before he reaches the bag. 
                    You can do a tag out at any time as long as the baserunner is not standing on the bad.
                    The last out the simplest one is a fly out and that is just when any defenseive player Catches
                    the ball off the bat before it hits the ground.
