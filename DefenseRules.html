                    The Goal of the defense is to get 3 outs as fast as possible so that the other team doesnt get the chance to score.

                    <strong>3 ways to get an out </strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Force Out
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Tag Out
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Fly out
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        A force out is when the player on the defense with the ball touches the bag before the baserunner gets there.
                        You can only do this if the baserunner is running to a bag that he is forced to run too. 
                        First base is always a force out becasue once you hit it then you have to go to first. 
                        And example of non force out play would be if there was a guy only on second and the batter
                        hits the ball the guy on second doesnt have to run becasue no one is currently on first. 
                        This case if the baserunner decides to go to third you must try and tag him out. 
                        The Player with the ball must physically tag the baserunner before he reaches the bag. 
                        In many situatuions if the tag out play is unlikey to work the defense with throw the ball to first and take the force out.
                        You can get a tag out at any time as long as the baserunner is not standing on the bag.
                        The last out the simplest one is a fly out and that is just when any defenseive player Catches
                        the ball off the bat before it hits the ground.
