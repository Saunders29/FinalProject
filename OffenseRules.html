                <p>
                As a batter you go up to the plate and have to try and hit the ball off the pitcher before he gets 3 strikes.
                A strike is a pitch that is in a zone that is from the top of the batters knees to the middle of his torso,
                and goes the with of homeplate. If you get to 3 strikes in one at bat then youre automatically out. If you swing the pitch is automatically a strike and if you foul it off meaning you 
                hit the ball that isnt inside the white lines that are on the field then that is a strike as well, but you can 
                not strike out on a foul ball. 
                If you already have 2 strike on you then you continue to have 2 stike till you either put the ball in play, the pitchers
                thorws a stike that you do not make contact with, or walk. 
                A walk is when the pitcher thorws 4 pitches in the same at bat that you do not swing at nor is in the strike zone. If this 
                happens the batter automatically gets to go to firstbase.
