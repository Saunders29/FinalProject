                As a batter you go up to the plate and have to try and hit the ball off the pitcher before he gets 3 strikes.
                A strike is a pitch that is in a zone that is from the top of the batters knees to the middle of his torso,
                and goes the with of homeplate. If you get to 3 strikes in one at bat then youre automatically out. If you swing the pitch is automatically a strike and if you foul it off meaning you 
                hit the ball that isnt inside the white lines that are on the field then that is a strike as well, but you can 
                not strike out on a foul ball. 
                If you already have 2 strike on you then you continue to have 2 stike till you either put the ball in play, the pitchers
                thorws a stike that you do not make contact with.

                <strong>3 Ways to get on base</strong> 
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Hit
                        <ul>
                            <li>Single- The Batter stay on first</li>
                            <li>Double- The Batter make it to second</li>
                            <li>Triple- The Batter makes it too third</li>
                            <li>Homerun- The Batter hits the ball over the fense and goes all the way home</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>    
                        Walk or Hit by Pitch
                        <ul>
                            <li>A walk is when a pitcher thorow 4 balls that arent a strike the batter goes to first for free</li>
                            <li>If the the pitcher hits the batter with the ball then the batter goes to first for free</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Error
                        <ul>
                            <li>The batter hits the ball and the defense make a bad play and deosnt get an out</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                The difference between a hit and an error is if the player is given a hit then the defense didnt have any 
                chance to get the batter out. An error is the batter hits right to a player on defense and they make a bad throw or 
                the ball rolls between their legs.
